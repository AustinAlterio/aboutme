		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> I am a UCONN Digital Media and Design Student soon to graduate come 2016. My goal in life is to further my skills in 3D animation and motion graphics so I can create work that is not only <strong>great</strong> but work that I am <strong>proud</strong> of. Things that interest me are new job oportunites that allow me the chance to learn something new and push me to my limits. I love cold weather which is probably the reason I don't mind living in Connecticut. Volleyball is my favorite sport and the sport I'm best at. I have four siblings, an an older brother and a younger brother and sister. At some point in my life I would love to own a yellow lab and a husky. If interested in working with me at some point in the future please contact me and I will respond as soon as possible!
